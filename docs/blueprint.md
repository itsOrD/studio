# **App Name**: PromptVerse

## Core Features:

- Drag and Drop Input: Allow users to drag and drop text into the extension to save it as a prompt.

- Copy to Clipboard: Provide clickable buttons next to each stored prompt to copy the text to the user's clipboard.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Indigo (#4B0082) to convey a sense of organization and intelligence, reflecting the app's prompt management capabilities.
- Background color: Very light lavender (#F0F8FF), offering a clean, non-distracting backdrop that helps keep the focus on the prompts. Its desaturated and light nature ensures it does not clash with the primary color.
- Accent color: Violet (#8F00FF), positioned 30 degrees to the 'left' of Indigo on the color wheel. This creates contrast with Indigo, making interactive elements such as 'copy to clipboard' buttons stand out and draw attention.
- Additional Accent color: Deep Pumpkin Orange (#FF7518) to highlight important actions and add warmth.
- Clean and legible font for easy readability of prompts.
- Simple, intuitive icons for actions like 'copy,' 'edit,' and 'delete.'
- Organized layout with clear sections for input, stored prompts, and action buttons.
- Subtle feedback animations on button clicks to enhance user experience.
